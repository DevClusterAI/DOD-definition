# Code Quality - Definition of Done

## Unit Tests
- [ ] All new code is covered by unit tests
- [ ] All unit tests pass successfully
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are tested
- [ ] Tests are properly documented with clear assertions
- [ ] Test execution time is within acceptable limits

## Integration Tests
- [ ] Integration tests cover all system interfaces
- [ ] All integration tests pass successfully
- [ ] Tests include boundary conditions and error handling
- [ ] Mock services are properly implemented where needed
- [ ] Integration test suite runs in CI/CD pipeline

## Code Coverage
- [ ] Minimum code coverage threshold of ___% is met
- [ ] No critical paths are left untested
- [ ] Coverage reports are generated and reviewed
- [ ] Any exclusions from coverage metrics are documented and justified
- [ ] Branch coverage meets minimum requirements

## Linting Standards
- [ ] Code passes all linting rules without exceptions
- [ ] No warnings or errors in static code analysis
- [ ] Code formatting follows team standards
- [ ] No commented-out code is present
- [ ] Naming conventions are followed consistently

## Type Safety
- [ ] All variables, parameters, and return values are properly typed
- [ ] No implicit type conversions that could cause issues
- [ ] Generic types are used appropriately
- [ ] Type declarations are documented where necessary
- [ ] No 'any' types used without justification (for TypeScript)

## Verification Process
1. Run automated test suite
2. Generate and review code coverage report
3. Execute static code analysis
4. Conduct peer code review against standards
5. Document any exceptions with justification
