# Code Review Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the code review process, standards, and best practices to ensure consistent, high-quality code reviews across all projects. Code reviews are a critical quality assurance step that helps maintain code quality, share knowledge, and prevent defects from reaching production.

## Purpose of Code Reviews

Code reviews serve several important purposes:

1. **Quality Assurance**: Identify bugs, security vulnerabilities, and other issues before they reach production
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Spread domain and technical knowledge throughout the team
3. **Consistency**: Ensure adherence to coding standards and architectural patterns
4. **Mentorship**: Provide learning opportunities for both reviewers and authors
5. **Documentation**: Ensure adequate code documentation and test coverage
6. **Ownership**: Foster collective code ownership and shared responsibility

## Code Review Process

### 1. Preparation

#### For Code Authors:
- Keep changes small and focused (ideally < 400 lines of code)
- Include comprehensive tests covering new functionality
- Perform self-review before requesting formal review
- Provide context in the pull request description
- Link to relevant tickets or requirements
- Highlight areas of concern or questions for reviewers

#### For Reviewers:
- Understand the context and purpose of the change
- Review the associated requirements or issue
- Plan adequate time for thorough review
- Focus on one aspect at a time (e.g., functionality, security, etc.)

### 2. Submission

- Code authors submit changes through pull/merge requests
- Tag appropriate reviewers based on:
  - Code ownership
  - Domain expertise
  - Technical expertise
  - Learning opportunities
- Set appropriate expectations for review timeframe
- Include any special instructions or contextual information

### 3. Review

- Reviewers examine code within one business day when possible
- Each review should address multiple dimensions:
  - Correctness and functionality
  - Design and architecture
  - Test coverage and quality
  - Security considerations
  - Performance implications
  - Maintainability and readability
  - Documentation completeness

### 4. Feedback

- Provide clear, constructive feedback
- Distinguish between required changes and suggestions
- Explain the "why" behind feedback
- Use a consistent feedback format
- Reference coding standards or guidelines when applicable
- Acknowledge positive aspects of the implementation

### 5. Iteration

- Authors respond to all feedback
- Make requested changes or discuss alternatives
- Update the pull request with new changes
- Request re-review when significant changes are made
- Keep the conversation constructive and focused on the code

### 6. Approval

- Minimum of 2 approvals required for merging
- Final approver verifies all required changes are addressed
- All automated checks must pass (CI, linting, tests)
- Meet all quality gates defined for the project

### 7. Merge

- Author merges after receiving required approvals
- Squash commits if appropriate for clean history
- Delete feature branches after merging
- Verify deployment if applicable

## Code Review Standards

### What to Look For

#### 1. Functionality
- Does the code work as expected?
- Does it handle edge cases appropriately?
- Are there potential race conditions or concurrency issues?
- Is error handling comprehensive and appropriate?
- Does it meet all requirements?

#### 2. Architecture and Design
- Does the code follow architectural principles?
- Is it consistent with existing patterns?
- Are responsibilities properly separated?
- Is the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?
- Does it use appropriate design patterns?
- Are there clear abstractions and boundaries?

#### 3. Security
- Is user input properly validated and sanitized?
- Are authentication and authorization handled correctly?
- Are there potential injection vulnerabilities?
- Is sensitive data properly protected?
- Are security best practices followed?
- Are proper error messages shown (not revealing internals)?

#### 4. Performance
- Are there potential performance bottlenecks?
- Is resource usage efficient?
- Are appropriate data structures used?
- Are database queries optimized?
- Is caching used appropriately?
- Is the code efficient for the expected scale?

#### 5. Testing
- Is there adequate test coverage?
- Do tests cover edge cases?
- Are tests readable and maintainable?
- Do tests verify the expected behavior?
- Are there integration and unit tests as appropriate?
- Are the tests independent and reliable?

#### 6. Readability and Maintainability
- Is the code easy to understand?
- Is variable/method naming clear and descriptive?
- Is there appropriate documentation?
- Is the code formatted consistently?
- Is complexity minimized?
- Would a new team member understand this code?

#### 7. Coding Standards
- Does the code follow project style guidelines?
- Are language idioms used appropriately?
- Are there linting or static analysis issues?
- Is the code consistent with the rest of the codebase?

## Best Practices for Reviewers

### 1. Communication Guidelines

- **Be Kind and Respectful**
  - Focus on the code, not the person
  - Frame feedback as suggestions, not commands
  - Acknowledge good solutions and practices
  - Avoid tone and language that could be perceived as harsh

- **Be Clear and Specific**
  - Provide concrete examples
  - Explain reasoning behind suggestions
  - Link to relevant documentation or standards
  - Be explicit about what needs to change

- **Be Constructive**
  - Suggest improvements, not just point out problems
  - Provide alternatives when rejecting an approach
  - Focus on knowledge sharing, not criticism
  - Offer to discuss complex issues in person if needed

### 2. Review Techniques

- **Two-Pass Review**
  - First pass: Get an overview of the changes
  - Second pass: Detailed line-by-line review

- **Focus on Key Areas First**
  - Architecture and design issues
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Performance bottlenecks
  - Functionality correctness
  - Then move to style and minor issues

- **Use Tools Effectively**
  - Leverage automated code analysis
  - Use IDE features for comprehensive reviews
  - Run the code if possible
  - Check test results and coverage

- **Ask Questions**
  - Seek to understand the author's approach
  - Use questions to guide authors to discover issues
  - Clarify requirements or expectations

### 3. Efficiency Tips

- Schedule dedicated time for reviews
- Review regularly in smaller chunks
- Don't review for more than 60 minutes at a time
- Use checklists for consistency
