# Testing Requirements & Standards

## Overview

Comprehensive testing is crucial for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions. This document outlines the testing requirements, standards, and best practices that all team members must follow.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- Coverage requirement: minimum 80%
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests simple and focused

### Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Cover critical system paths
- Test external service integration
- Verify data flow between components
- Include error handling scenarios

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user workflows
- Cover critical business scenarios
- Test in production-like environment
- Include performance considerations
- Verify system integration points

### Performance Testing
- Load testing for normal conditions
- Stress testing for peak loads
- Endurance testing for stability
- Scalability verification
- Response time benchmarks

## Test Design Principles

### 1. FIRST Principles
- **Fast**: Tests should run quickly
- **Independent**: Tests should not depend on each other
- **Repeatable**: Consistent results across runs
- **Self-validating**: Pass/fail without manual interpretation
- **Timely**: Written at the appropriate time

### 2. Test Structure
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Clear test naming convention
- One assertion per test (recommended)
- Descriptive failure messages
- Proper test organization

### 3. Test Quality
- No test logic (loops, conditions)
- Deterministic results
- Clear setup and teardown
- Appropriate use of fixtures
- Meaningful test data

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Coverage Requirements
- Unit test coverage: 80%+ (required)
- Integration test coverage: 60%+ (recommended)
- Critical path coverage: 100% (required)
- Branch coverage: 70%+ (recommended)
- UI component coverage: 75%+ (recommended)

### 2. Performance Requirements
- Response time < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Load test success rate > 99%
- Resource usage within limits
- No memory leaks
- Scalability verified

### 3. Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- Coverage thresholds met
- No critical security issues
- Performance criteria met
- Code review completed

## Test Implementation

### 1. Test Organization
- Mirror production code structure
- Logical test grouping
- Clear file naming
- Appropriate use of test suites
- Separate test utilities

### 2. Test Data Management
- Use test data factories
- Avoid production data
- Clean up test data
- Version control test data
- Document data requirements

### 3. Mocking Strategy
- Clear mocking guidelines
- Consistent mocking approach
- Document mock requirements
- Version control mocks
- Mock external services

## Testing Tools

### 1. Testing Frameworks
- Language-specific test frameworks
- Mocking frameworks
- Assertion libraries
- Coverage tools
- Performance testing tools

### 2. Continuous Integration
- Automated test execution
- Regular scheduling
- Results reporting
- Trend analysis
- Alert configuration

### 3. Quality Tools
- Code coverage tools
- Performance profilers
- Memory leak detectors
- Security scanners
- Static analysis tools

## Test Documentation

- Maintain test data

### 2. Test Efficiency
- Optimize test execution
- Parallel test execution
- Appropriate test scope
- Resource cleanup
- Efficient test data

### 3. Test Reliability
- Handle flaky tests
- Stable test environment
- Proper error handling
- Timeout management
- Retry mechanisms

## Review Process

### 1. Test Review Checklist
- Test coverage adequate
- Test cases comprehensive
- Documentation complete
- Performance verified
- Security considered

### 2. Quality Gates
