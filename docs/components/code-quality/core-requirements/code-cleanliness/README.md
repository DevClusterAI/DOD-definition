# Code Cleanliness & Maintainability Standards

## Overview

Code cleanliness and maintainability are essential aspects of high-quality software development. This document outlines the standards and practices that all team members must follow to ensure clean, readable, and maintainable code.

## Code Organization

### File Structure
- One primary class/component per file
- Logical grouping of related files in directories
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent file naming conventions
- Maximum file length of 500 lines (recommended)

### Code Layout
- Consistent indentation (spaces or tabs as per project standard)
- Logical grouping of related code blocks
- Clear separation between functions/methods
- Appropriate use of whitespace
- Maximum line length of 80-120 characters

## Naming Conventions

### General Rules
- Use meaningful and descriptive names
- Follow language-specific conventions
- Be consistent across the codebase
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood

### Specific Conventions
1. **Variables**
   - Clear and descriptive names
   - Camel case for most languages
   - Avoid single-letter names except for loops
   - Use meaningful prefixes when appropriate

2. **Functions/Methods**
   - Verb-noun combination
   - Descriptive of the action performed
   - Clear parameter names
   - Maximum of 3-4 parameters recommended

3. **Classes/Components**
   - Noun or noun phrase
   - Clear indication of responsibility
   - Singular form
   - PascalCase naming

4. **Constants**
   - All uppercase
   - Words separated by underscores
   - Clear and descriptive names

## Code Style

### General Principles
1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Avoid code duplication
   - Extract common functionality
   - Use appropriate design patterns

2. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
   - Write simple, straightforward code
   - Avoid unnecessary complexity
   - Break down complex operations

3. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
   - Don't add functionality until necessary
   - Avoid speculative features
   - Focus on current requirements

### Specific Guidelines

1. **Functions/Methods**
   - Single responsibility
   - Maximum length of 20-30 lines
   - Clear entry and exit points
   - Appropriate error handling
   - Documented parameters and return values

2. **Comments and Documentation**
   - Clear and concise comments
   - Documentation for public APIs
   - Explanation of complex algorithms
   - Update comments with code changes
   - Avoid obvious comments

3. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error handling approach
   - Meaningful error messages
   - Appropriate use of try-catch blocks
   - Proper logging of errors
   - Error recovery where appropriate

## Code Smells to Avoid

1. **Complexity Smells**
   - Deep nesting
   - Complex conditions
   - Long methods
   - Large classes
   - High cyclomatic complexity

2. **Maintainability Smells**
   - Duplicate code
   - Dead code
   - Magic numbers
   - Hard-coded values
   - Tight coupling

3. **Performance Smells**
   - Inefficient algorithms
   - Unnecessary object creation
   - Memory leaks
   - Resource leaks
   - Inappropriate data structures

## Best Practices

1. **Code Organization**
   - Logical file organization
   - Clear module structure
   - Consistent project layout
   - Separation of concerns
   - Clear dependencies

2. **Code Readability**
   - Self-documenting code
   - Clear intent
   - Consistent formatting
   - Appropriate abstraction
   - Meaningful names

3. **Code Maintainability**
   - Low coupling
   - High cohesion
   - Clear dependencies
   - Easy to test
   - Easy to modify

## Tools and Enforcement

1. **Linting**
   - Use appropriate linters
   - Configure rules appropriately
   - Regular linting checks
   - Automated enforcement

2. **Code Formatters**
   - Consistent formatting tools
   - Automated formatting
   - Pre-commit hooks
   - IDE integration

3. **Static Analysis**
   - Regular static analysis
   - Code quality metrics
   - Complexity checks
   - Security analysis

## Review Process

1. **Pre-Review Checklist**
   - Code follows standards
   - Tests are included
   - Documentation is updated
   - No obvious issues

2. **Review Guidelines**
   - Focus on maintainability
   - Check for code smells
   - Verify error handling
   - Ensure proper testing

## Continuous Improvement

- Regular review of standards
- Team feedback incorporation
- Updates based on project needs
- Training and knowledge sharing
- Regular refactoring sessions
