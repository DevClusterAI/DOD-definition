# Technical Debt Management

## Overview

This document outlines our approach to identifying, measuring, tracking, and remediating technical debt to ensure code quality, maintainability, and sustainable development velocity.

## What is Technical Debt?

Technical debt refers to the implied cost of future rework caused by choosing an expedient solution now instead of a better approach that would take longer. It represents the gap between the current state of our codebase and the ideal state that it should be in.

### Types of Technical Debt

- **Code Debt**: Poorly written or non-standard code
- **Design Debt**: Suboptimal architecture or design decisions
- **Documentation Debt**: Missing, outdated, or incomplete documentation
- **Testing Debt**: Inadequate test coverage or quality
- **Architecture Debt**: System design flaws or outdated patterns
- **Infrastructure Debt**: Outdated or non-standard infrastructure
- **Knowledge Debt**: Dependency on specific individuals or tribal knowledge
- **Dependency Debt**: Outdated or problematic dependencies
