# DoD Implementation and Verification Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides practical instructions for implementing and verifying the Definition of Done (DoD) criteria across all project components. Following these procedures ensures consistent quality and completeness across deliverables.

## Implementation Process

### 1. Project Initialization
- Review and customize DoD checklists for project-specific needs
- Define minimum thresholds for all quantitative metrics
- Integrate DoD verification into development workflow
- Configure automated verification where possible

### 2. Sprint Planning
- Include DoD criteria in story point estimation
- Allocate time for DoD compliance activities
- Create task items specifically for DoD verification
- Document any agreed exceptions to standard DoD

### 3. Development Process
- Reference DoD checklist during implementation
- Conduct incremental DoD checks
- Address DoD items in parallel with development
- Utilize automated tools for continuous verification

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Execute formal DoD verification before QA handoff
- Document verification results for each component
- Reject incomplete work that fails DoD criteria
- Maintain verification records for audit purposes

## Verification Methods

### Automated Verification
- Configure CI/CD pipeline tests for automatable criteria
- Generate compliance reports for code quality metrics
- Schedule regular performance test runs
- Implement security scanning in the build process

### Manual Verification
- Conduct peer reviews using DoD checklists
- Perform structured testing for non-automatable items
- Document manual verification with evidence
- Schedule regular DoD audits by technical leads

## DoD Compliance Reporting

### Individual Components
- Generate component-level DoD compliance report
- Document any exceptions with justification
- Track compliance metrics over time
- Identify recurring compliance challenges

### Project Level
- Aggregate component compliance into project dashboard
- Report DoD compliance percentage in sprint reviews
- Identify systemic DoD compliance issues
- Track DoD evolution and effectiveness

## Continuous Improvement

### DoD Refinement
- Review DoD criteria at end of each project phase
- Add new criteria based on production issues
- Remove or modify ineffective criteria
- Calibrate thresholds based on practical experience

### DoD Automation
- Continually increase percentage of automated verification
- Develop custom tools for project-specific verification
- Integrate verification results into developer feedback
- Create self-service verification capabilities

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Team Members
- Complete DoD checklist for assigned work
- Report DoD compliance challenges proactively
- Participate in DoD verification activities
- Suggest improvements to DoD criteria

### Team Leads
- Enforce DoD compliance across team
- Review DoD exceptions and approve when justified
- Coach team on meeting DoD requirements
- Evolve DoD to match project needs

### Project Management
- Allocate resources for DoD compliance
- Include DoD metrics in project reporting
- Address systemic DoD compliance issues
- Balance DoD requirements with delivery timelines
