# Monitoring - Definition of Done

## Health Checks
- [ ] Health check endpoints implemented for all services
- [ ] Health checks verify critical dependencies
- [ ] Health status reporting is standardized across services
- [ ] Self-healing mechanisms implemented where applicable
- [ ] Health check integration with orchestration systems
- [ ] Degraded service states properly reported

## Alert Rules
- [ ] Alert thresholds defined for critical metrics
- [ ] Alert severity levels appropriately assigned
- [ ] Alert routing and escalation paths defined
- [ ] Alert suppression and grouping configured to prevent noise
- [ ] False positive mitigation strategies implemented
- [ ] After-hours alerts limited to true emergencies

## Metrics Collection
- [ ] System-level metrics configured (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- [ ] Application-specific metrics implemented
- [ ] Business metrics captured where appropriate
- [ ] Metric retention policies configured
- [ ] Metric collection impact on performance is minimal
- [ ] Custom metrics for key business functions

## Dashboards
- [ ] Operational dashboards created for all critical systems
- [ ] Executive/business dashboards for key metrics
- [ ] Team-specific dashboards for relevant subsystems
- [ ] Dashboard access permissions configured
- [ ] Dashboards include documentation/context
- [ ] Critical alerts visible on dashboards

## Tracing & Observability
- [ ] Distributed tracing implemented across services
- [ ] Request correlation IDs maintained
- [ ] Key transactions have end-to-end tracing
- [ ] Log correlation with traces configured
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks can be identified through tracing

## Verification Process
1. Verify all health checks in staging/production
2. Test alert triggering and notification
3. Confirm metric collection and retention
4. Review dashboard functionality and access
5. Validate observability of key transactions
6. Document monitoring coverage and gaps
